Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.\n","\n","The app allows restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.\n","\n","### Objective\n","\n","The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company improve its business.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Data Dictionary\n","\n","The data contains the different data related to a food order.

When plotted the number of restaurants with respect to cuisines, It was seen that these cuisines had highest number of restaurants\n","* Cost of the orders ranged on the lower side of spectrum which might indicate that the restaurants are very budget friendly and hence can be attributed to the fact that most of people would turn the app during the weekends\n","* It is also interesting to note that majority of the orders took similar time to prepare the food. The trend is similar across all cuisine, days of the week and ratings.\n","* There is also no relationship in (food preparation time v/s cost) and (delivery time v/s cost) which doesn't follow a trend of inverse correlation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PWnsI0i_guWJ"},"source":["### Recommendations:\n","\n","*  Ratings should be made mandatory for all orders as it might help in understanding bad orders and the feedback coming from those ratings can be used to improve customer service\n","* More restaurants from other cuisines should be also be onboarded which can be done by marketing to local and small restaurants.\n","* Foodhub should try to focus more on restaurants having less orders per day as by recommending them first while searching for a particular cuisine."]}]}
